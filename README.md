## What's Baize?
Baize is an open-source chat model fine-tuned with [LoRA](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA). It uses 100k dialogs generated by letting ChatGPT chat with itself. We also use Alpaca's data to improve its performance. We have released 7B and 13B models. 30B and 60B models coming soon. 

## Why it's called Baize?
Baize (白泽) is a mythical creature in Chinese folklore, who speaks human languages and knows everything. This is exactly what we expect from a chat model.
